        <h2>Baby Driver</h2>
            <p>I love this movie it is definitely on eon my all time favourites. The movie has an amazing sound track and story line. Baby Driver has it all romance, action. Car chases and life lessons. It is a movie I can watch a million times and never get sick of. I never had a favourite movie until I watched this. It isn’t the best movie of all time (in some peoples opinion) but it definitely hits a lot of movie genres.</p>
<p>Baby Driver in not a new movie by any means it was released in 2017, but I have seen it recently because I rewatch it all of the time. Sometimes just to listen to the soundtrack and dialogue. I don’t even watch the movie itself. Is that strange…maybe. </p>
